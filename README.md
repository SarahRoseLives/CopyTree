ðŸ“‹ CopyTree
===========

**CopyTree** is a command-line tool that walks through your current directory, collects source code files (filtered by extension), prints a visual tree of matched files, and copies the content of those files into your clipboard. This is especially useful when sharing code with AI tools or collaborators, allowing for instant copy-paste of structured project code.
